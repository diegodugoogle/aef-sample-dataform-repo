- **dataform:**
  - Houses your table definitions using a structure recommended for Dataform repositories.
  - Subfolders organized by Dataplex lakes and zones for clear structure.
  - The `dataform.json` file, generated by Terraform, provides parameters to reference the Terraform-created infrastructure during Dataform operations.
